How to Translate
================

You can translate the kniteditor project.
The :mod:`kniteditor.localization` has a `translations subfolder
<https://github.com/fossasia/kniteditor/blob/master/kniteditor/localization/translations>`__
There you can find the translations.

There is also a `youtube video
<https://youtu.be/9M4y_dUpoeg>`__ on how to translate to new languages.
If you like to add translations to an existing language, you may need to
update your language from the ``kniteditor.pot`` file in the translations folder
and  follow the same upload/pull-request process as in the video.
